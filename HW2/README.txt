README

There are different folders for different questions.
Each folder consist of plots (either images or error/accuracy graph).
Keras is used to import mnist dataset.
cv2 is used to resize the images from 28*28 to 14*14.
Rest the whole code is written using numpy.
Some codes take a quite long time to train hence final images(results) are attached.
The figures attached contains the 1st two rows as input and last 2 rows as output.
In Variational Autoencoder, The generated images using the decoder are also attached (they are quite noisy but some digits are visible).
